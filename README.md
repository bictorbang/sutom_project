A friend of mine plays this game religiously. I got converted and started playing every day at midnight. I don't want to blatantly cheat and look up the answer, so instead I made this tool to help me solve the game. Is it still considered cheating ? Yes. But at least I had fun coding this small project. And I'll most likely never lose SUTOM again.

What is SUTOM ? 

It's a French game derived from "MOTUS". 


What's next ?

I'll probably do the same thing with pedantle / cemantix.
